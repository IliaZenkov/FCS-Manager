I first developed FCS Manager for my research position at McGill University in 2018 to convert FCS files into PANDAS DataFrames for easier exploratory analysis than was available using FlowJo at the time. 

I used FCS Manager as a proof-of-concept to test automation capabilities for a high-throughput antibody screening data pipeline. Since then, I've used this FCS Manager to produce analyses included in at least one high-level grant application. 

**Only tested and safe for use with FCS3.0 and FCS3.1 files.** If you intend to use FCS Manager in your research, I **strongly urge** you to cross-check your analyses with FlowJo or similar flow package before integrating this code into your project. </br>**Tested on FCS data from BD FACSAria, BD FACSCalibur, and guava easyCyte machines.**

Feel free to copy, modify, use, and distribute as you see fit.
