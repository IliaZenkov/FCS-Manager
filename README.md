The long-awaited FCS Manager I first developed for my research position at McGill University in 2018 is now publically available!

First created to as a proof-of-concept to test automation capabilities for a high-throughput antibody screening data pipeline.

Since then, I've used this FCS Manager to produce results gone on to at least one high-level grant application. 

Safe to use with FCS3.0 and FCS3.1 files. If you intend to use FCS Manager in your research, I strongly urge you to cross-check your analyses with FlowJo or similar flow package before integrating this code into your project.

Feel free to copy, modify, use and distribute as you see fit!
